You need working python, reasonably recent version (such as 2.3).
If you use ordinary mailboxes (not maildirs), you need lockfile program,
which is part of procmail package. lockfile should be installed with
appropriate privileges to be able to lock your mailbox - check out
procmail's documentation.

Copy pycmail executable somewhere (such as /usr/local/bin) and modify
the first line of it to point to your python interpreter.

Copy (and modify) pycmailrc to /etc. Pay special attention to location of
sendmail and lockfile.

Put this into your ~/.forward:
|/usr/local/bin/pycmail

Some mailers need quotes:
"|/usr/local/bin/pycmail"

Qmail does this differently (see qmail's documentation).

Edit your ~/.pycmailrc file. Look at examples/ directory for some examples.
